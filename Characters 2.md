# Creating a Character; notes

## Step One

### Characteristics

* The optional characteristic Education (EDU) is used and so should be rolled
  for and taken into account.

* Cultural Modifiers is used but is based on planetary characteristics rather
  than culture. Generate a home planet for your character using either the basic way presented in TNE:17-18 or, if you prefer, the more advanced way in
  TNE:179-195. Then modify your characteristics as follows:

*Gravity*  
* 0.0 G - 0.2 G: STR -2, CON -2, SIZ -2
* 0.3 G - 0.5 G: STR -1, CON -1, SIZ -1
* 1.5 G - 1.9 G: STR +1, CON -1, SIZ +1
* 2.0+ G: STR +2, CON -2, SIZ +2

If the gravity is 0G it can be said that the home world in fact was a space
station or something similar with some form of artificial gravitation present.
If so, decide on a reasonable gravity level and use that instead.

*Atmosphere*  
* Vacuum: DEX +1
* Tainted: CON -1

*Population*  
* Incidental or Low: APP -1
* High: APP +1

*Tech Level*  
* Pre-Industrial: EDU -2, CON +1
* Early eller Average Stellar: EDU +1
* High Stellar: EDU +2

## Step Two (powers)

Not used for now. Psychic powers may possibly be added at a later stage.

## Step Three (age)

As a rule-of-thumb, characters in Futur Noir should be professionals with some
experience and so be a little older. 25 to 30 years old is about right.

## Step Five (derived characteristics)

### Damage Bonus

Futur Noir uses a different system for describing damages based on an
abstraction called Damage Class (DC). Each point of DC corresponds to &frac12;d6 so that DC 1 = &frac12;d6, DC 2 = 1d6, DC 3 = 1&frac12;d6, etc. Each character
then has a pair of modifiers, one based on size and strength that is used to
modify the damage in hand-to-hand combat, and one based on intelligence and
agility that is used for ranged combat. Hmm, is this really a good idea?

| STR+SIZ  | Damage Modifier | INT+DEX  |
| :------: | :-------------: | :------: |
|  2 to 12 |       -2        |  2 to 12 |
| 13 to 16 |       -1        | 13 to 16 |
| 17 to 24 |      +-0        | 17 to 24 |
| 25 to 32 |       +1        | 25 to 32 |
| 33 to 40 |       +2        | 33 to 40 |

### Hit Points per Location

Is used.

### Fatigue Points

Is used.

### Skill Category bonuses

Is used.

### Sanity

Is used. Or?

### Cool

This is a new characteristic intended to simulate the ability of combat-
experienced individuals to remain calm while under attack. Keeping a cool head
during combat aids in initiative.
