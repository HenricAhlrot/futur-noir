# Creating a Character

## Step One (name & characteristics)

### Name

#### *Example:*

Osborn would like to create a space pilot and decides on a man named Gukuu (a
Vilani name).

### Characteristics

* The optional characteristic Education (EDU) is used and so should be rolled
  for and taken into account.

* Cultural Modifiers is used but is based on planetary characteristics rather
  than culture. Generate a home planet for your character using either the basic
  way presented in TNE:17-18 or, if you prefer, the more advanced way in
  TNE:179-195. Then modify your characteristics as follows:

*Gravity*  
* 0.0 G - 0.2 G: STR -2, CON -2, SIZ -2
* 0.3 G - 0.5 G: STR -1, CON -1, SIZ -1
* 1.5 G - 1.9 G: STR +1, CON -1, SIZ +1
* 2.0+ G: STR +2, CON -2, SIZ +2

If the gravity is 0G it can be said that the home world in fact was a space
station or something similar with some form of artificial gravitation present.
If so, decide on a reasonable gravity level and use that as basis for the
gravity modification instead.

*Atmosphere*  
* Vacuum: DEX +1
* Tainted: CON -1

*Population*  
* Incidental or Low: APP -1
* High: APP +1

*Tech Level*  
* Pre-Industrial: EDU -2, CON +1
* Early eller Average Stellar: EDU +1
* High Stellar: EDU +2

#### *Example:*

For Gukuu, Osborn rolls for Strength 12, for Constitution 10, for Power 9, for
Dexterity 14, for Appearance 8, for Size 13, for Intelligence 11, and for EDU
10. He chooses to redistribute two points from STR and one from SIZ in order to
raise DEX by three points. His final characteristics (before homeworld effects)
are: STR 10, CON 10, SIZ 12, INT 11, POW 9, DEX 17, APP 8, and EDU 10.

Gukuus home world has the following attributes: Starport A, Size Small, Gravity
0G, Atmosphere Thin, Hydrosphere Wet, Population Moderate, Government Moderate,
Law Level Moderate, Tech Level Average Stellar. Together with the GM it is
decided that the lack of gravity should not have an impact as the fairly high
Tech Level probably means that the entire population lives on bases or stations
having artificial gravity. As a result, Gukuus only modification based on his
home word is EDU +1 based on the Tech Level. His final characteristics ends up
like this: STR 10, CON 10, SIZ 12, INT 11, POW 9, DEX 17, APP 8, EDU 11. A set
of characteristics with both character and edge.

## Step Two (powers)

Not used for now. Psychic powers may possibly be added at a later stage.

## Step Three (age)

As a rule-of-thumb, characters in Futur Noir should be professionals with some
experience and so be a little older. 25 to 30 years old is about right.

#### *Example:*

For Gukuu, Osborn rolls 2 for his default age. Added to 17 it ends up at 19.
Taking a hint from the skills section (see below) he decides Gukuu to have
completed 3 terms of service. This puts his final age at 17 + (3 x 4) or 29
years old. That is enough to award Gukuu with an additional point of EDU so it
ends up at 12.

## Step Four (characteristic rolls)

#### *Example:*

Gukku's characteristic rolls are: Effort 50%, Stamina 50%, Idea 55%, Luck 45%,
Agility 85%, Charisma 40%, and Know 60%.

## Step Five (derived characteristics)

### Damage Bonus (Dmg Bonus)

Futur Noir uses a different system for describing damages based on an
abstraction called Damage Class (DC). Each point of DC corresponds to &frac12;d6
so that DC 1 = &frac12;d6, DC 2 = 1d6, DC 3 = 1&frac12;d6, etc.

The bonus as described here then provides a modification to damage done in
hand-to-hand combat. For instance, a person being large and/or strong enough to
get a +1 DC modification would, using a DC 3 weapon, actually use DC 4 in
combat.

| STR+SIZ  | Damage Modifier |
| :------: | :-------------: |
|  2 to 12 |       -2        |
| 13 to 16 |       -1        |
| 17 to 24 |      +-0        |
| 25 to 32 |       +1        |
| 33 to 40 |       +2        |

#### *Example:*

Gukuu's damage bonus, based on his STR 10 and SIZ 12 (sum 22), is +-0.

### Hit Points

Hit Points (HP):

#### *Example:*

Gukuu's HP = (10 (CON) + 12 (SIZ)) / 2 = 11 points.

### Hit Points per Location (HP per Location)

This optional rule is used.

#### *Example:*

Gukuu: head etc. 4 points, chest 5 points, and arms 3 points.

### Fatigue Points (FP)

This optional rule is used.

#### *Example:*

Gukuu's FP = 10  (STR) + 10 (CON) = 20 points.

### Power points

Power Points (PP): Max = POW.

Powers are not used for now but this value should still be written down.

#### *Example:*

Gukuu's PP = POW = 9 points.

### Experience Bonus

Experience Bonus: &frac12; INT, rounding up.

#### *Example:*

Gukuu's experience bonus is: + 11 (INT) / 2 % = 6 %

### Skill Category bonuses

This optional rule is used.

#### *Example:*

Gukuu's skill category bonuses are: Combat +7%, Communication +0%, Manipulation
+7%, Mental +2%, Perception +1%, and Physical +5%.

### Movement

Movement (MOV): 10 units.

## Step Six (personality)

This optional rule is not used.

## Step Seven (skills)

### Professional skill points

| Term | Age    | Skill pts | Special pts | BRP
|:-----|-------:|:---------:|:-----------:|-------------
|  0   | 17     | 0         | 0           |
|  1   | 18-21  | 4*        | 4           | +EDU x 7 pts
|  2	 | 22-25  | 4*        | 4           | +EDU x 7 pts
|  3	 | 26-29  | 3*        | 3           | +EDU x 5 pts
|  4	 | 30-33  | 2*        | 2*          | +EDU x 4 pts
|  5+	 | 34+    | 1*        | 1*          | +EDU x 2 pts

*Or First Term skill packet for first term in a new career.

#### *Example:*

Osborn has decided that Gukuu should have completed three terms of service. His
final EDU is 12. For the first term, Gukuu receives 12 x 7 = 84 professional
skill points. For the second, he receives the same amount or 84 more. Finally,
on his third term, he earns 12 x 5 = 60 additional professional skill points
making the grand total 84 + 84 + 60 = 228 points.

### Personal skill points

Equals INT x 10.
