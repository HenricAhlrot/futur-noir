# Creating a Character

## Step One (name & characteristics)

*Options used: Cultural Modifiers, Education*

### Name

* Choose a name and select a gender for your character.

*Example:* Osborn would like to create a space pilot and decides on a man named
Gukuu (a Vilani name).

### Characteristics

* Roll 3d6 for the characteristics Strength (STR), Constitution (CON), Power
  (POW), Dexterity (DEX), and Appearance (APP)
* Roll 2d6+6 for the characteristics Size (SIZ), Intelligence (INT), and
  Education (EDU)
* If you wish, redistribute up to three points
* Modify characteristics according to the attributes of your home world (see
  below)

*Example:* For Gukuu, Osborn rolls for Strength 12, for Constitution 10, for
Power 9, for Dexterity 14, for Appearance 8, for Size 13, for Intelligence 11,
and for EDU 10. He chooses to redistribute two points from STR and one from SIZ
in order to raise DEX by three points. His final characteristics (before
homeworld effects) are: STR 10, CON 10, SIZ 12, INT 11, POW 9, DEX 17, APP 8,
and EDU 10.

### Cultural Modifiers

Where your come from can modify your characteristics. In Futur Noir, this is
based on the nature of your original home environment rather than your culture
such -- your home world. Use the World Generation System to generate the details
of the world where you grew up and then modify your characteristics as follows:

#### Gravity

* 0.0 G - 0.2 G: STR -2, CON -2, SIZ -2  
* 0.3 G - 0.5 G: STR -1, CON -1, SIZ -1  
* 1.5 G - 1.9 G: STR +1, CON -1, SIZ +1  
* 2.0+ G: STR +2, CON -2, SIZ +2  

If the gravity is 0G it can be said that the home world in fact was a space
station or something similar with some form of artificial gravitation present.
If so, decide on a reasonable gravity level and use that instead.

#### Atmosphere

* Vacuum: DEX +1
* Tainted: CON -1

#### Population

* Incidental or Low: APP -1
* High: APP +1

#### Tech Level

* Pre-Industrial: EDU -2, CON +1
* Early eller Average Stellar: EDU +1
* High Stellar: EDU +2

*Exemple:* Gukuus home world has the following attributes: Starport A, Size
Small, Gravity 0G, Atmosphere Thin, Hydrosphere Wet, Population Moderate,
Government Moderate, Law Level Moderate, Tech Level Average Stellar. Together
with the GM it is decided that the lack of gravity should not have an impact as
the fairly high Tech Level probably means that the entire population lives on
bases or stations having artificial gravity. As a result, Gukuus only
modification based on his home word is EDU +1 based on the Tech Level. His final
characteristics ends up like this: STR 10, CON 10, SIZ 12, INT 11, POW 9, DEX
17, APP 8, EDU 11. A set of characteristics with both character and edge.

## Step Two (powers)

Not used for now. Psychic powers may possibly be added at a later stage.

## Step Three (age)

The default age for characters is 17+1d6 years old. Your character's starting
age must be at least EDU+5 (to represent the time spent actually learning).
Every 10 years added to your character's starting age (amounts less than 10
years do not count for this bonus), adds +1 to your character's EDU
characteristic. As a rule-of-thumb, characters in Futur Noir should be
professionals and so be a little older. 25 to 30 years old is about right.

*Example:* For Gukuu, Osborn rolls 2 for his default age. Added to 17 it ends up
at 19. Taking a hint from the skills section (see below) he decides Gukuu to
have completed 3 terms of service. This puts his final age at 17 + (3 x 4) or
29 years old. That is enough to award Gukuu with an additional point of EDU so
it ends up at 12.

## Step Four (characteristic rolls)

* Effort Roll = STR x 5
* Stamina Roll = CON x 5
* Idea Roll = INT x 5
* Luck Roll = POW x 5
* Agility Roll = DEX x 5
* Charisma Roll = APP x 5
* Know Roll = EDU x 5

*Example:* Gukku's characteristic rolls are: Effort 50%, Stamina 50%, Idea 55%,
Luck 45%, Agility 85%, Charisma 40%, and Know 60%.

## Step Five (derived characteristics)

### Damage Bonus

Add STR + SIZ and find the damage bonus corresponding to your character's total
on the table below.

| STR+SIZ  | Damage Modifier |
| :------: | :-------------: |
|  2 to 12 |     -2          |
| 13 to 16 |     -1          |
| 17 to 24 |    +-0          |
| 25 to 32 |     +1          |
| 33 to 40 |     +2          |

*Example:* Gukuu's damage bonus, based on his STR 10 and SIZ 12, is +-0.

### Hit points (HP)

Add CON + SIZ and divide the result by 2. Round up any fraction. This number is
your character's maximum hit points.

*Example:* Gukuu's HP = 11 points.

#### Hit Points per Location

Determine the number of hit points for each of your character's hit locations.
The head, abdomen, and each leg have 1/3, the chest has 4/10, and each arm has
1/4 of the character's maximum hit point value. Round all fractions up.

*Example:* head etc. 4, chest 5, arms 3.

### Fatigue points (FP)

Add STR + CON. This number is your character's maximum fatigue points.

*Example:* Gukuu's FP = 20 points.

### Power points

Your character's power points is equal to your character's POW. Powers are not
used but this value should still be written down.

### Experience Bonus

Your character's experience bonus is equal to 1/2 INT, rounded up.

### Skill category bonuses

Note the primary, secondary, and negative characteristics of each category in
table below.

* Primary characteristics add 1% for every point over 10, and subtract 1% for
  every point under 10.
* Secondary characteristics add 1% for every 2 points over 10, and subtract 1%
   for every 2 points under 10. Round down.
* Negative characteristics subtract 1 % for every point over 10, and add 1% for
  every point under 10.

| Category              | Primary | Secondary | Negative |
| --------------------- | :-----: | :-------: | :------: |
| Combat skills         |   DEX   | STR, INT  |   --     |
| Communications skills |   INT   | POW, APP  |   --     |
| Manipulation skills   |   DEX   | STR, INT  |   --     |
| Mental skills         |   INT   | POW, EDU  |   --     |
| Perception skills     |   INT   | CON, POW  |   --     |
| Physical skills       |   DEX   | STR, CON  |   SIZ    |

*Example:* Combat +7%, Communication +0%, Manipulation +7%, Mental +2%,
Perception +1%, Physical +5%.

Each character Their careers are measured in terms of service, each four years long, and each character have served from one to four or possible five such terms. Either base this on a random roll of 1d4 or use the optional Background Details to generate your age. Your character's age is then 17 plus 4 more years per term served.

Status

Färdigheten Status (Imperial) används för att täcka upp Travellers grundvärde Social Standing men ingen börjar med någon särskild nivå. Startvärdet är 3 + Communication Skill Bonus.

(Eller? Är det intressant med en tabell med olika statusnivåer? Bör spelarkaraktärer kunna få ha hög status från start?)
