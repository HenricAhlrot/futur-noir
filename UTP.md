## The Universal Task Profile

Here I present an adapted form of the UTP from MegaTraveller. It is a
standardized way to describe tasks which fits the nature of SF gaming well. The
standard as described had to be retrofitted into BRP somehow and this is it.

The intended use is to be able to describe tasks such that they are quick and
easy to interpret in a compact form. The GM can prepare UTPs in advance and,
over time, build up a catalog of them, promoting easy re-use.

### Format

**Task Phrase**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To accomplish a given task:  
**Task Specification**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Difficulty Level, Main Skill, Complimentary Skill, Time
Increment (Risk Qualifier)  
**Comments**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional notes for the GM.

### Difficulty Level

* Automatic (no roll needed)
* Easy (Skill x 2)
* Average (Skill x 1)
* Difficult (Skill x 1/2)
* Impossible (no roll allowed or only 1% chance, GM's discretion).

### Main Skill

This is just the name of the main skill (or the characteristic roll) the GM
judges this task should be rolled against. If a characteristic is entered and
the risk qualifier is confrontational, then this is a task describing a
situation calling for use of the resistance table such as POW vs. POW or CON vs.
POT.

### Complimentary Skill

An optional skill which can act as complimentary to the main skill according to
the BRP rules on the matter.

### Time Factor

The time increment on a task profile is 10 percent of the typical task duration.
A roll of 3d6 determines how many increments the task takes. The increment is
always one-tenth of the typical task duration.

If the duration of the task doesn't matter, the task is *Instant* and that's
that. No time roll is made.

If the duration *always* takes the same time, the task is *Absolute*. No time
roll is made.

The duration of an attempt equals the increment times 3D6 (after the critical
success chance of the main skill involved are applied). The minimum is 3
increments.

### Risk Qualifiers

* Standard: default case, not stated
* Safe: With *safe* tasks if a mishap occurs, it is never damaging
* Hazardous: With *hazardous* tasks, there is a high likelihood of a serious
  mishap if the task fails
* Fateful: With *fateful* tasks, a mishap is guaranteed if the task fails. Don't
  confuse this with hazardous, which indicates the seventy of mishap. "To avoid
  a mishap" situations are good examples of fateful tasks because if they fail,
  the mishap has not been avoided
* Uncertain: With *uncertain* tasks, the result of the attempt is largely
  opinion or cannot be confirmed. Those individuals associated with the task
  have some idea of how successful the task attempt was, however, they are not
  certain of the outcome. Sensor readings, Interchanges between characters
  (including any task which might require a reaction roll), psionics,
  computer programming, repairs, and research are all good candidates for
  uncertain tasks
* Confrontation: When two opposing sides are working at cross-purposes, the task
  becomes a *confrontation*

### Hasty or Cautious Tasks

* Standard: default case, not stated. Assumes the character is taking a
  reasonable amount of care while performing the indicated task
* Hasty: When a player is in a hurry, he can specify that he would prefer a
  hasty task. The time required is shorter, but the task becomes harder. The
  task DMs are doubled before subtracting them from the time roll, the task
  difficulty increases one level.

### Sample tasks:  

To avoid close inspection of papers:  
Easy, Fast Talk, Knowledge (Admin), 1 min (fateful)  
*GM:* This task assumes a world with No Law. Increase difficulty one level for
each increase in law code: Low Law is Average; Mod Law is Difficult; Hi Law or
higher is Impossible.

To avoid police harassment:  
Easy, Fast Talk, Knowledge (Admin) or Knowledge (Legal), 5 min (fateful)  
*GM:* Increase the difficulty for this task one level for each increase in law
code above No Law.
