# Preface

Futur Noir is based on a mixture of several different systems and ideas. The
basic system presented here is based on Basic Role-Playing by Chaosium.

# Creating a Character

## Step One (name, characteristics, and home world)

*Options used: Cultural Modifiers, Education*

### Name

* Choose a name and select a gender for your character.

*Example:* Osborn would like to create a space pilot and decides on a man named
Gukuu (a Vilani name).

### Characteristics

* Roll 3d6 for the characteristics Strength (STR), Constitution (CON), Power
  (POW), Dexterity (DEX), and Appearance (APP)
* Roll 2d6+6 for the characteristics Size (SIZ), Intelligence (INT), and
  Education (EDU)
* If you wish, redistribute up to three points
* Modify characteristics according to the attributes of your homeworld (see
  below)

*Example:* For Gukuu, Osborn rolls for Strength 12, for Constitution 10, for
Power 9, for Dexterity 14, for Appearance 8, for Size 13, for Intelligence 11,
and for EDU 10. He chooses to redistribute two points from STR and one from SIZ
in order to raise DEX by three points. His final characteristics (before
homeworld effects) are: STR 10, CON 10, SIZ 12, INT 11, POW 9, DEX 17, APP 8,
and EDU 10.

### Home World

#### Size

| 1d100 | Size     |
|-------|----------|
| 01-03 | Asteroid |
| 04-42 | Small    |
| 43-83 | Medium   |
| 84-00 | Large    |

#### Gravity

| 1d100 | Gravity |
| 01-XX | 0 G     |


* Roll 2d6 once for each column on the table below. Modify the results using the
  modifiers listed directly after the table.

|2d6|Starport|Gravity|Atmosphere |Hydrosphere|Population|Government|Law Level|Tech Level     |
|---|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|---------|---------------|
| 2 |   A    |0G     |Vacuum     |Desert     |Incidental|Low       |No       |Pre-Industrial |
| 3 |   A    |.1G    |Vacuum T*  |Desert     |Incidental|Low       |Low      |Pre-Industrial |
| 4 |   A    |.2G    |Thin       |Dry        |Incidental|Low       |Low      |Industrial     |
| 5 |   A    |.4G    |Thin T*    |Dry        |Low       |Moderate  |Moderate |Industrial     |
| 6 |   B    |.6G    |Standard   |Wet        |Low       |Moderate  |Moderate |Pre-Stellar    |
| 7 |   B    |.8G    |Standard T*|Wet        |Low       |Moderate  |Moderate |Pre-Stellar    |
| 8 |   C    |1G     |Standard   |Wet        |Moderate  |High      |Moderate |Early Stellar  |
| 9 |   C    |1.2G   |Dense T*   |Wet        |Moderate  |High      |Moderate |Early Stellar  |
|10 |   D    |1.5G   |Dense      |Wet        |Moderate  |High      |High     |Average Stellar|
|11 |   E    |1.8G   |Extreme    |Wet        |High      |Extreme   |High     |Average Stellar|
|12 |   E-X  |2Gs    |Extreme    |Water      |High      |Extreme   |Extreme  |High Stellar   |

T* = Tainted

**Starport:** If 12 E-X: roll 1d6, on 1-3 E, on 4-6 X

**Gravity:** If Size = Asteroid, Gravity = 0G, if Size = Small, apply -3, if Size = Medium and if the result is 2-3 or 11-12, re-throw, if Size = Large, apply +4

**Atmosphere:** If Size = Asteroid, Atmosphere = Vacuum, if Size = Small, apply -2, if Size = Large, apply +2

**Hydrosphere:** If Size = Asteroid, Hydrosphere = Desert, if Size = Small, apply -2, if Size = Large, apply +2

**Government:** If Population = Incidental, apply -4, if Population = Low, apply -2, if Population = High, apply +2

**Law Level:** If Government = Low, apply -2, if Government = High, apply +2, if Government = Extreme, apply +4

**Tech Level:** If Starport = A, apply +3, if Starport = B, apply +2, if Starport = C, apply +1, if Starport = X, apply -2, if Size = Asteroid, apply +1, if Hydrosphere = Water, apply +1, if Population = Low, apply +1, if Population = High, apply +2

Now that the homeworld is known, modify characteristics as follows:

Gravity  
0G-.2G: STR -2, CON -2, SIZ -2  
.3G-.5G: STR -1, CON -1, SIZ -1  
1.5G-1.9G: STR +1, CON -1, SIZ +1  
2G+: STR +2, CON -2, SIZ +2  

If the gravity is 0G (dice roll 2 on the table above) it can be said that the home world in fact was a space station or something similar with some form of artificial gravitation present. If so, decide on a

Atmosphere
	Vacuum: DEX +1
	Tainted: CON -1

Population
	Incidental eller Low: APP -1
	High: APP +1

Tech Level
	Pre-Industrial: EDU -2, CON +1
	Early eller Average Stellar: EDU +1
	High Stellar: EDU +2

Exempel: Gukuus homeworld has the following attributes: Starport A, Size Small, Gravity 0G, Atmosphere Thin, Hydrosphere Wet, Population Moderate, Government Moderate, Law Level Moderate, Tech Level Average Stellar. Together with the gamemaster it is decided that the low gravity does not have an impact as the fairly high Tech Level probably means the entire Population lives on stations having artificiall gravity. As a result, Gukuus only modification based on his homeword is EDU +1 based on the Tech Level. His final characteristics ends up like this: STR 10, CON 10, SIZ 12, INT 11, POW 9, DEX 17, APP 8, EDU 11. A set of characteristics with both character and edge.
